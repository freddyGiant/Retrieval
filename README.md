Final Project for 15-104. Interpretation of the idea of obscured memory and aging through images and particles. 
My program starts with the image being clear then getting distorted when the particles age, representing the idea of aging throughout time and how memory gets forgotten as we age. To interact with the program, I allowed the user to ‘speed’ up the aging process and create distortion using mouseX and mouseY movement. My program relies on storytelling and letting the user watch as the images move through time.
